        Founded in 1914, Greyhound Lines, Inc. is the largest provider of intercity bus transportation, serving more than 3,800 destinations with 13,000 daily departures across North America. It has become an American icon, providing safe, enjoyable and affordable travel to nearly 25 million passengers each year. The Greyhound running dog is one of the most-recognized brands in the world.

        While Greyhound is well known for its regularly scheduled passenger service, the company also provides a number of other services for its customers. Greyhound PackageXpress service offers value-priced same-day and early-next-day package delivery to thousands of destinations. And the company's Greyhound Travel Services unit offers charter packages for businesses, conventions, schools and other groups at competitive rates.

        Greyhound has three operating subsidiaries in the United States, which are a part of the nationwide Greyhound network. They include: Valley Transit Company, serving the Texas-Mexico border, Crucero USA, serving southern California and Arizona into Mexico, and Americanos USA, serving points in Mexico from Texas and New Mexico.

        In addition, Greyhound has interline partnerships with a number of independent bus lines across the United States. These bus companies provide complementary service to Greyhound Lines' existing schedules and link to many of the smaller towns in Greyhound Lines' national route system.

        Amtrak passengers use Greyhound to make connections to cities not served by rail on Amtrak Thruway service, by purchasing a ticket for the bus connection from Amtrak in conjunction with the purchase of their rail ticket. If passengers desire, they may also buy a bus ticket directly from Greyhound.

        For travel within Canada, Greyhound Canada carries millions of passengers across the country's provinces and territories each year. The company also provides Greyhound Courier Express package delivery service to its various Canadian locations.

        For those within Mexico who wish to travel by Greyhound in the United States, Greyhound subsidiary Greyhound de Mexico can sell Greyhound tickets at one of more than 100 agencies located throughout Mexico. The agencies also sell tickets for several Mexican bus companies, like Estrella Blanca, which connect to Greyhound service at the United States-Mexico border cities.

            BusCatchers is a search engine for intercity travel that is specialized to the East Coast of the US.  Since it is a search engine that searches other search engines, it is a meta-search engine.  BusCatchers aggregates more scheduling, pricing, and location information for bus and train travel between major East Coast cities than any other  website currently available on the internet.  BusCatchers does not sell tickets.  Tickets must be purchased from the websites of the respective companies.  The purpose of BusCatchers is to empower users by helping them make well-informed ticket purchases.

            At any hour of the day, the BusCatchers core engine is hard at work, fetching data for thousands of bus trips directly from the websites of the various bus companies.  To fetch this data, BusCatchers must navigate the user interfaces of different websites, carefully clicking on the appropriate buttons and inputing the correct information.  These  travel dates are stored in a database, and are refreshed twice a day to ensure high accuracy.
